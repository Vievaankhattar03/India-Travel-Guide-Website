                <p>India, celebrated for its rich cultural heritage and diverse landscapes, is organized into a distinctive administrative framework that includes 28 states and 8 Union Territories. 
                Each of the 28 states operates with its own government, reflecting the diverse regional cultures, histories, and traditions across the country. 
                These states manage their local affairs and development, contributing to the nation's vibrant and varied landscape.<br>
                In addition to the states, India is home to 8 Union Territories, which are directly governed by the Central Government. 
                These territories often include areas of strategic importance or those requiring special administrative attention, ensuring effective management and representation.<br>
                This unique combination of 28 states and 8 Union Territories provides a balanced approach to governance, blending regional autonomy with central oversight. 
                As you explore India, you'll experience a tapestry of cultures, landscapes, and traditions, each shaped by its administrative framework, from bustling urban centers and historic sites to serene natural wonders.</p>
